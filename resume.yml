  summary: |
    I'm seeking compelling work in an environment where I can shoulder
    responsibility and innovate. I'm equally at-home automating cloud infrastructure
    deployment as I am collaborating with non-technical stakeholders, and
    care deeply about the ergonomics of products I maintain. I feel most
    alive in chaotic environments and am more than capable of delivering
    competent and pragmatic solutions to any problem thrown my way.
